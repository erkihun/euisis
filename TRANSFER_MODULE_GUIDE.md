# Transfer Module Guide

## Overview

The Transfer Module is a standalone subsystem that manages inter-organization employee transfers through a structured, configurable workflow.

The module replaces the legacy `employee_transfers` direct-action flow with a multi-step announcement → application → screening → approval → completion pipeline.

---

## Architecture

### Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `transfer_settings` | Singleton row — configurable transfer policies |
| `transfer_announcements` | Transfer vacancy postings per organization/position |
| `transfer_applications` | Employee applications to announcements |
| `transfer_application_documents` | Supporting documents per application |
| `transfer_screening_reviews` | Audit trail of screening actions |
| `transfer_approvals` | Release / Receiving / Final approval records |
| `transfer_rule_overrides` | Override requests for policy exceptions |

### Key Invariants

- **Employee UUID never changes.** Only `EmployeeAssignment` records are modified.
- **Employee number never changes.**
- **No assignment change before all required approvals are complete.**
- **Every state change is audited** via `WriteAuditLogAction`.

## Workflow

```
Announcement (draft → published)
    ↓
Application submitted by employee
    ↓
Screener moves to UnderReview
    ↓
[Optional] Documents verified
    ↓
Candidate selected → approval chain begins
    ↓
  [if releasing_consent_required]  ReleasePending → ReleaseApproval
    ↓
  [if receiving_consent_required]  ReceivingPending → ReceivingApproval
    ↓
  [if final_approval_required]     FinalApprovalPending → FinalApproval
    ↓
Application status = Approved → CompleteTransferAction runs
    ↓
  old assignment closed (effective_to set, is_current = false)
  new assignment created (organization = receiving org)
  employee.current_assignment_id updated
  [if card policy] CardRequest created
  [if service policy] Entitlements recalculated
  Application status = Transferred
```

## Transfer Settings

Managed via `TransferSetting` (singleton). Access via `TransferSetting::current()`.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|

| `allow_exceptional_override` | false | Allow policy overrides |
| `override_approver_roles` | null | Roles that can approve overrides |
| `required_documents` | null | List of required document types |
| `minimum_service_months` | 0 | Minimum months before transfer |
| `releasing_consent_required` | true | Releasing org must approve |
| `receiving_consent_required` | true | Receiving org must approve |
| `final_approval_required` | false | City/Bureau final approval |
| `card_reprint_policy` | `request_reprint` | `no_reprint` / `request_reprint` / `auto_reprint` |
| `service_recalculation_policy` | `recalculate_from_effective_date` | `no_recalculation` / `recalculate_from_transfer` / `recalculate_from_effective_date` |

## Testing

```bash
# Run Transfer Module tests only
php artisan test --filter=TransferModule

# Run full suite
php artisan test
```

### Test coverage
- Transfer settings retrieval and update
- Announcement date validation
- Announcement publish guards
- Employee application submission
- Duplicate application blocking
- Closed announcement rejection
- Employee identity preservation (UUID, number unchanged)
- Old assignment closed / new assignment created
- Approval-required guard (cannot complete without approval)
- Full approval chain (release → receiving → auto-complete)

---

## Assignment Update Rule

`CompleteTransferAction` is the **only** place where assignments change:

```php
// 1. Lock employee
$employee = $application->employee()->lockForUpdate()->firstOrFail();
$currentAssignment = $employee->currentAssignment()->lockForUpdate()->firstOrFail();

// 2. Close old assignment
$currentAssignment->update([
    'assignment_status' => AssignmentStatus::Closed,
    'is_current' => false,
    'effective_to' => now()->toDateString(),
]);

// 3. Create new assignment
$newAssignment = EmployeeAssignment::query()->create([
    'employee_id' => $employee->id,  // SAME UUID
    'organization_id' => $application->receiving_organization_id,
    ...
]);

// 4. Update pointer
$employee->update(['current_assignment_id' => $newAssignment->id]);

// 5. Mark transferred
$application->update(['status' => TransferApplicationStatus::Transferred]);
```

Employee `id` and `employee_number` are **never touched**.
