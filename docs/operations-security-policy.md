6. Access grant is recorded in the audit log

### Revoking Access
1. HR/Project Manager notifies System Administrator of termination or role change
2. System Administrator deactivates the account immediately (`/users/{user}/deactivate`)
3. System Administrator revokes all Sanctum API tokens
4. For privileged roles: verify all active sessions are terminated
5. Revocation recorded in audit log
6. Access review completed within 24 hours of notification
