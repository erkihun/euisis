# INSA Secure Website Management Standard — Compliance Audit

**Project:** EUISIS — Addis Ababa City Administration Employee Unified ID & Service Integration System  
**Standard:** INSA Secure Website Management Standard Version 1.0, 2014 EC  
**Auditor:** Senior Security Architect  
**Audit Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Review Cycle:** Quarterly

---

## Executive Summary

EUISIS is a government-critical Laravel 12 / React / Inertia v2 platform handling encrypted PII (national IDs, phone numbers), digital ID cards with QR codes, RBAC, multi-factor authentication, and a cafeteria subsidy module. This audit maps the system against all five phases of the INSA standard and both annexes. Overall posture is **GOOD** for a pre-production system; critical gaps are in hosting documentation and formal operational procedures.

| Phase | Status | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|
| Requirement Gathering & Analysis | Partial | Medium |
| Design | Implemented | Low |
| Implementation | Partial | Medium |
| Hosting | Documentation Only | High |
| Operation & Management | Documentation Only | High |
